# Algorithms-Data_Structures
Homework I did in CSCI 3333 Algorithms and Data-Structures

TrendTracker01 Developed with an efficient vector-based data structure for keeping track of a popular topic hashtag. The vector tracks info on hashtags that are popular and top trending. 

TrendTracker02 uses a similar Vector to store hashtags, but that's not very efficient if you want to store millions of unique hashtags.
In this program i used an efficient two-vector-based data structure.
